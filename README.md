In one of my classes we have a group skype chat where we talk smack and share resources. A lot of those resources are lost in the void as soon as the conversation continues. This is a tool to remedy that.

The idea is that I can dump the entire chat log, time stamps and all, into a text file. I can then use the link finder application to go through and find all of the hyperlinks, including gifs and images, and then output those into a readable format. 

The end state will have options for what types of hyper links to search for:
* Any / All
* only images
* only web pages
* only .PDF links

And will display these discovered links in a new window for the user to edit, save, or copy-pasta to their heart's content. 

All issue and status tracking will be done via this trello: https://trello.com/b/7UpBK9q0/linkfinder

Help me out! Fork it and branch it!
